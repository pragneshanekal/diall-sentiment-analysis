"Morning. Honestly, it's been kind of rough. Work has been incredibly stressful. There's this project I'm working on, and it feels like no matter how much I do, it's never enough. The deadlines, the expectations... it's overwhelming.",0.134,0.714,0.152,-0.0498
"Sure, it's like, every day I wake up dreading to check my emails because I know there'll be something from my boss, adding more to my plate. And it's not just work, you know? It's like everything else just piles on top of that. My personal life isn't going great either. I've been trying to manage my time better, but nothing seems to work.",0.064,0.811,0.125,0.2853
"I don't know... I try to keep myself busy outside of work, hoping I can distract myself from these thoughts. I started going for runs in the evening, which helps a bit. But then, when I stop, all the anxiety just rushes back. Sometimes, I just sit there, trying to meditate or something, but my mind races with a million thoughts. It's exhausting.",0.155,0.785,0.059,-0.7184
"It's like, I start thinking about where I am in life, questioning my choices. Am I in the right career? Am I making the right decisions? It's this constant doubt. And then, I think about my relationships. I've been feeling disconnected from my friends, like I'm just going through the motions. Last weekend, I was out with them, and I just couldn't wait to get home, to be alone. It didn't use to be like this.",0.074,0.769,0.157,0.7622
"Being alone feels simpler, less draining. But then, it's also lonely, you know? It's like I can't win. When I'm with people, I feel out of place, and when I'm alone, I wish someone understood what I'm going through. Sometimes, I wonder if I'm the problem, if I'm just too much for people.",0.234,0.659,0.107,-0.7968
"I guess... it's just nice to be heard, you know? To say all this out loud without feeling judged. I'm not sure what I'm looking for, maybe just a way to feel less stuck.",0.141,0.781,0.078,-0.0616

"I'm curious, yeah. What kind of activity?",0.0,0.526,0.474,0.5423
"Journaling, huh? You know, I've thought about it before but never really knew where to start. I guess, with everything going on, it could be a good way to sort through my thoughts. I'm constantly juggling so many feelings and thoughts; laying them out might help me understand them better. Plus, there's something about putting pen to paper that feels... I don't know, therapeutic? I can already think of a few things I'd want to write about. Like, how running makes me feel or why certain emails spike my anxiety. And maybe, why I feel so out of place with my friends lately. It's all jumbled up in here, pointing in every direction. I think journaling could help me untangle some of that. How often do you think I should do it?",0.014,0.799,0.187,0.9771
"Yeah, that sounds doable. A few times a week. I can see myself carving out a little time before bed or maybe in the morning when things are quieter. This could be my little experiment, you know? See if it makes a difference in how I process my day or manage stress. And I like the idea of having something to look back on, to see how I've grown or changed over time. It's kind of exciting, in a way.",0.036,0.867,0.097,0.5868
"Thanks. That means a lot, actually. Today felt like a good step. It's not easy talking about all this stuff, but it feels right. Like I'm finally starting to address what's been bothering me.

"They've been a bit more manageable. My mood feels more stable, and I don't find myself getting overwhelmed as easily. There are still tough days, but I feel like I have a bit more control.",0.037,0.734,0.229,0.6753
"I've been trying to stay more logical and goal-directed. When I start to feel anxious, I remind myself of the coping strategies we discussed, and that helps me not spiral into negative thoughts.",0.056,0.787,0.157,0.5571
"I've been trying to incorporate mindfulness practice more regularly. I started with just a few minutes, and now I'm trying to expand that. It's been interesting to see how it affects my day.",0.0,0.853,0.147,0.6124
"That sounds good. I want to keep improving. I know there's more I can do, especially when it comes to handling stress more effectively.",0.097,0.552,0.352,0.7501
I think that's doable. I'm curious to see how journaling will add to the mindfulness practice. And expanding to 15 minutes seems like a good challenge.,0.0,0.69,0.31,0.7906

"Good morning. I've been doing okay, I guess. There's been a slight increase in my anxiety levels, but I've also felt a bit more capable of handling it, thanks to the relaxation techniques you introduced. It's been a bit of a mixed bag.",0.027,0.624,0.349,0.9431
"Sure. I've been trying to incorporate those breathing exercises and mindfulness into my daily routine. It helps, especially in moments when I feel the anxiety creeping up. But there are times when it just feels like it's not enough. I get these waves of panic, and it's hard to concentrate on anything else.",0.125,0.761,0.113,-0.1779
"I try to remind myself that it's just anxiety and it will pass. Sometimes I have to step away from whatever I'm doing and find a quiet space to do the breathing exercises. It usually helps to some extent, but it's exhausting having to fight this battle inside my head so frequently.",0.208,0.761,0.031,-0.8807
"My mood's been generally stable, I suppose. But there are moments when I feel really low, especially after a panic attack. It's like, I can see myself overreacting, but I can't help it. My thoughts start spiraling, thinking about the worst-case scenarios.",0.3,0.605,0.095,-0.9107
"My thoughts? Yeah, they tend to go to the worst places. It's like my mind automatically jumps to catastrophic conclusions over the smallest things. I know it's illogical, but in the moment, it feels so real.",0.119,0.795,0.086,-0.3182
"I've been trying to challenge them, like we talked about. Asking myself if my thoughts are based on facts or just my anxiety talking. It's tough, though. Sometimes, I catch myself slipping into old habits of thinking.",0.082,0.821,0.097,0.1531
I think my judgment gets clouded when I'm anxious. I tend to make decisions based on how I'm feeling rather than what's logical. But I'm working on it. Trying to take a step back and assess situations more objectively.,0.071,0.896,0.034,-0.09
"It's been helpful. Setting aside time for those exercises makes me feel like I'm taking control of my anxiety, even if it's just for a little while. It's become something I look forward to each day.",0.045,0.816,0.139,0.5574
I think we covered most of it. I just want to keep building on this progress and find more ways to cope with my anxiety. Sometimes I worry about backsliding.,0.143,0.715,0.142,-0.0129
I feel good about it. Talking about these things helps me see them more clearly. And knowing there's a plan gives me hope.,0.0,0.599,0.401,0.8858

Good morning. It's been quite a challenging couple of weeks. I've noticed my anxiety and depression symptoms have been more intense. I find myself getting more anxious over things that I would normally handle better. And my mood... it's been really low.,0.2,0.615,0.184,-0.2023
"Yeah, I've been under a lot of stress lately. Work has been overwhelming, and I feel like I'm constantly on edge. My sleep has been off too.

"It's been difficult. My concentration is shot. I find it hard to focus on my work, and everything takes twice as long to get done. I've also been more irritable, which isn't like me. I've snapped at a few people, and then I feel terrible about it afterward.",0.238,0.762,0.0,-0.8886
"I've tried, but it's been hard to stick to anything. I did start practicing mindfulness like we talked about. It helps a bit, especially at night when I'm trying to calm my mind. But I feel like I need to do it more consistently.",0.032,0.708,0.26,0.9052

"Sure. The hopeful moments usually come when I feel like I'm making progress, like when I'm able to get through a stressful day at work without feeling completely drained. But then, there are triggers everywhere—deadlines, social interactions, even just watching the news. It feels like my mind is constantly on alert, waiting for the next thing to worry about.",0.102,0.656,0.241,0.7736

"My mood fluctuates a lot. There are days when I feel almost normal, but then I have days where I can barely get out of bed. It's frustrating because I know I have good days, but the bad days make me feel like I'm back at square one.",0.16,0.708,0.132,-0.3612
"I think I've gotten better at recognizing when I'm spiraling into anxiety or depression. It's still hard to pull myself out of it, but I'm trying to be more mindful of my thought patterns and how they affect my mood and decisions.",0.112,0.844,0.044,-0.2382

"On the good days, I feel more in control. I use the coping strategies we've discussed, and they actually work. I can catch myself before spiraling into negative thoughts and manage to redirect my focus. But on the bad days, it's like I forget everything I've learned.
